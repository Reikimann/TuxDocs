## About the project

Well hello there. This project was started as a discord-server for linux users (mostly at our school), because we (Logicguy1 & Reikimann) wanted to get people to transfer to linux. We realised that people don't want to do things that seems complicated, so that's where this project came into play.

We needed a way to introduce people to linux, that wouldn't want to watch hours of linux youtube content. So I, Reikimann, came up with the idea to write this massive markdown, chapter based leveling documentation, to introduce people to linux, some cool stuff and other ideas.

For now, the release-schedule of this project can't be determined, because of our school. We intent to release one chapter/level at a time to the main branch, but you are welcome to watch and contribute to the project through the Readme-edits branch.

# Chapter 1 - Getting Started

  - Managing package managers
